# Sensory and Seriously Hackathon

This project is our work prepared as part of the Sensory and Seriously Hackathon, which took place in Krakow on the 14th 
and 15th of October 2023. The project's goal was to create an application to assist visually impaired individuals in 
checking their appearance just before leaving their homes. The full version of the application includes checking 
details such as holes or stains on clothing. During approximately 30 hours of designing and coding, we implemented a system to 
evaluate whether colors match each other. This functionality will assist not only visually impaired individuals but 
also anyone who has difficulty with choosing suitable colors.

We based this system on computer vision models available in the Google Cloud Vision API and by following color 
combination schemes such as complementary and monochromatic.
